## From Firefighting to Engineering

The role of a Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) has evolved from being the "operator who codes" to a core enabler of platform engineering. In 2026, SRE is less about manual incident response and more about building resilient platforms.

## Platform Engineering

Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs) are the new standard. SREs are now building self-service portals (like Backstage) that allow developers to spin up infrastructure independently, while maintaining guardrails.

## Reliability as Code

Defining reliability metrics (SLOs and SLIs) as code ensures they are version-controlled and tracked alongside the application.

- **SLO (Service Level Objective):** The target reliability (e.g., 99.9%).
- **Error Budgets:** The allowed amount of unreliability.

## Human-Centric SRE

Burnout is a real issue. Modern SRE practices focus heavily on reducing toil—manual, repetitive work—allowing engineers to focus on high-value tasks and maintaining a healthy work-life balance.
